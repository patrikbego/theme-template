## Project Structure

The project structure is as follows:

.
├── components
│   ├── CustomCheckboxDemo.js
│   ├── CustomCheckboxDemo.test.js
│   ├── GlobalAlertBar.js
│   ├── GlobalAlertBar.test.js
│   ├── HeaderStateDemo.js
│   ├── HeaderStateDemo.test.js

- `components`: Contains reusable React components used in the application. Each component has its own JavaScript file and a corresponding test file.

- `pages`: Contains Next.js pages for routing. The `_app.js` file is the custom App component, `_document.js` is used for customizing the HTML document, and `index.js` is the main page component.

- `styles`: Contains CSS files for global styles (`globals.css`) and the theme configuration (`theme.js`).

- `utils`: Contains utility files for the project. `createEmotionCache.js` sets up the Emotion cache, while the `reducers` directory contains the `StateProvider` and `reducer` files for managing application state.
